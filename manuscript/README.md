MYC is a transcription factor frequently overexpressed in cancer. To determine how MYC drives the neoplastic phenotype, we performed transcriptomic analysis using a panel of MYC-driven autochthonous transgenic mouse models. We found that MYC elicited gene expression changes in a tissue-specific manner across B-cell lymphoma, T-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, and lung adenocarcinoma.  However, despite the gene expression changes being highly tissue-specific, we found a common pattern of upregulation of embryonic stem cell gene programs and downregulation of tissue-of-origin gene programs across MYC-driven cancers. These changes, representative of tissue dedifferentiation, may be facilitated by epigenetic changes that occur during tumorigenesis. Moreover, we found that although several cellular processes are represented among embryonic stem cell genes, ribosome biogenesis tends to be most specifically associated with MYC expression in human primary cancers while genes in other pathways, such as DNA replication, have weaker correlation with MYC. Such genes, although important for tumorigenesis, are not necessarily specific to MYC-driven cancers. Altogether, we find that MYC’s capability to drive tumorigenesis in multiple tissue types appears to be related to its ability to promote tissue dedifferentiation.

Among the genes that are commonly changed, only the genes most specifically associated with MYC expression appear to primarily be involved in ribosome biogenesis while those that 

We further find, through analysis of pan-cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, that the genes most specifically associated with MYC expression appear to primarily be involved in ribosome biogenesis. 

To further investigate which of the genes are associated with MYC expression in primary human cancers as opposed to not being specific for MYC, we profiled TCGA pan-cancer data and identify a 67 MYC gene signature. These genes, in contrast to the upregulated genes weakly associated with MYC, appear to primarily be involved in ribosome biogenesis.

Using pan-cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we identify a signature of 67 genes. 

To further investigate which of the genes are actually associated with MYC expression in primary human cancers as opposed to not being specific for MYC, we profiled TCGA pan-cancer data. We identify a signature of 67 of these common genes that are most highly associated with MYC in human cancer are ribosome biogenesis genes, while genes involved in DNA replication, cell cycle, and chromatin organization may not be as specific for MYC. From this, we derive a 67-. 


upregulated in MYC-driven tumorigenesis, 

Although the commonly upregulated embryonic stem cell gene programs include genes involved in various pathways such as ribosome biogenesis, DNA replication, cell cycle, and chromatin organization, we find that the genes most highly associated with MYC in human cancer are ribosome biogenesis genes. Additionally, we use pan-cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas to further identify genes that are highly associated with MYC in human cancer. We identify a 67-gene signature that consists primarily of ribosome biogenesis genes. Altogether, we find that MYC’s capability to drive tumorigenesis appears to be related to its ability to regulate both embryonic stem cell genes and tissue-lineage specific genes.

prognostic MYC signature of 43 genes was identified that includes a mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (MARS2), shown to have therapeutic potential in MYC-driven cancers. MYC’s capability to drive tumorigenesis appears to be related to its ability to regulate both embryonic stem cell genes and tissue-lineage specific genes.
